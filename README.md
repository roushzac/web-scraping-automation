# web-scraping-automation
My friend Adam had a task that was causing him a lot of stress at work and was gonna take a long time to do. This project automates that task.
He had to update an excel spreadsheet and check on a website to verify one data column was correct. he would have to do this for 4000 rows ... which would've taken him weeks.


I wrote two python scripts to webscrape that website and update the excel sheet. it turned what was three weeks of work into 20 minutes (webscraping is still slow)
